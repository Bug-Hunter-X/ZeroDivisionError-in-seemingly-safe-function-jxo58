This example showcases a common, yet subtle bug that might be difficult to identify. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` is supposed to gracefully handle division by zero by returning one of the input numbers when either is 0. However, if both input arguments are zero, it still proceeds to division, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError. This is an example of how logical branching can sometimes fail to catch edge cases.
